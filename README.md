The code is in data_cleaning.ipynb

The 'india' folder contains the shapefiles which i used to classify which state a particular coordinate of latitude and longitude falls into.
I thoroughly tested this and know its correct.

The citizenData folder contains the cleaned CSV files which are formatted similar to reference data for the ease of plotting and visualization.

The updated_alldata.csv is the backup dataset which i kept just in case. It is basically just the original dataset except that I filled in the state names using latitude and longitude and sorted it by species.
